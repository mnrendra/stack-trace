## Security Best Practices

This project follows these practices:

- ✅ Dependencies are scanned automatically using GitHub Dependabot.
- ✅ Code is scanned weekly using GitHub Advanced Security and a GitHub Actions analysis tool (CodeQL and OSSF Scorecard).
- ✅ Branch protection is enabled with required status checks for Pull-Requests.
- ✅ Changes are reviewed via Pull-Requests with multiple maintainers.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a **[Coordinated Disclosure](https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/CVD/Coordinated+Vulnerability+Disclosure)** approach:
- You notify us privately of the issue.
- We confirm and fix the issue internally.
- A fix is released and a public **disclosure** is made (if necessary).
